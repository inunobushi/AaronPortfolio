# AaronPortfolio

This is a fullstack Professional portfolio that I have built for my brother. Some items that are on the live site are not available in this Repo. This version is designed to be learning tool for everyone out there.

This stack is a MC#RN stack. MongoDB database, C# backend, React Frontend and .NET Core runtime.

As such it can be run on most Operating Systems. 

For windows developers, just import and run it like any other app. 

For mac developers, there are a few more options. 

You can:

Download Visual Studio Community for Mac

or

You can run it via the terminal after [installing the Net Core cli](https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/8/5/88544F33-836A-49A5-8B67-451C24709A8F/dotnet-sdk-2.1.300-osx-gs-x64.pkg). To run it via the terminal, after installing the cli, cd into the project directory containing the `.csproj` then use the command `dotnet run`.

In both cases, the project will open in the browser on `localhost:5000`.
